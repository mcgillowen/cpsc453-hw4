/*
*   Skeleton code for CPSC 453 Assignment 4
*
*   Based on code written by:
*   Karl Augsten   
*/

To compile, type:

make all

This will yield an executable called writepixels,
which writes the rendered image to TestScene.rgb which you will have to 
convert to .png using the command:

convert -size 512x512 -depth 8 TestScene.rgb File.png

The size of the image can be controlled within the file WritePixels.cpp

The skeleton code is structured so that it should compile and yield a black 
image when you run the executable. Please go through the code and write
the missing code related to tracing rays, lighting and computing intersections.
